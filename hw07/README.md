**Here is a link to my rendered [homwork07]

My pipeline is three parted:
 
 *Part I: download the [data]
 *Part II: explore the data with some [exploratory analysis]
 *Part III: run statistics and generate some [figures]


The final part of this exercise was to automate the process using this [document]

Reflection: The automation process is fascinating, however cumbersome at times. I drew out the path of dependencies I was aiming for before hand starting yet most of the trouble came down to the nitty gritty of actually getting code to run. I opted for an all R approach because I am not comfortable working in the shell and this seemed a little more user friendly on the front end.
