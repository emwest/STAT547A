#First download the desired data, in this case I am using the gapminder dataset made available by Jenny Bryan:
I had a bit of trouble getting the path name just so, as expected it can be quite finnicky. The destfile allows you to assign a name to the output file which gets stored in the directory you are working from.
```{r}
getwd()
devtools::install_github("richfitz/remake")
download.file("https://github.com/jennybc/gapminder/blob/master/inst/extdata/gapminder.tsv", destfile="gapminder.tsv")
download.file(url = "https://github.com/jennybc/gapminder/blob/master/inst/extdata/gapminder.tsv", destfile="gapmind2.tsv")

gappa<-read.delim("gapmind2.tsv")
View(gappa)
```
