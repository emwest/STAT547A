# STAT547A

I am new to the STAT 547 2017 cohort, having taken 545 last fall with Jenny Bryan. I am looking forward to building functions and learning how automate processes! 


In an effort to tszuj up my READMEs I stumbled upon a sweet [emoji cheatsheet](https://www.webpagefx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/)

:wave:Hey there reviewers! You can find links to my homework pages here:

:bull:[homework 10] is provided in 2 parts: [Part I](https://github.com/emwest/STAT547A/blob/master/hw10/hw10_part1.Rmd) provides an example of aquiring data using httr() without an authorization key and [Part II](https://github.com/emwest/STAT547A/blob/master/hw10/hw10_part2.R) provides an example that requires a key. Please note that because I used several purr functions part I is provided in html format, and part II is provided as code to run to preserve the security of the authorization key
